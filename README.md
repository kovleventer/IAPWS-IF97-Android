# IAPWS-IF97 steam property calculator for Android

Calculates various properties of steam and water using IAPWS-IF97. The desired property and the parameter types can be selected from a dropdown menu.

The calculations were based on XSteam, a similar library for LO calc and Excel (www.x-eng.com altough this link is pretty much dead).

While this app works, the project needs some reorganization and restructuring (TODO).
